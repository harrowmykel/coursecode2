CourseCode is a smart assignment solution.  It is designed to offer seamless assignment support for lecturers by providing dynamic tools and an easy-to-use interface. 
An assignment is created once an assignment code, which can be manually changed later, has been automatically assigned. 
This assignment code may then be shared to the students who submits the assignments using this code.
To create an assignment, a submission date is required, an optional description and title may also be provided. The description may be written in the markdown language or as a plain text.
The assignment code is automatically deactivated immediately the submission date and time is reached. 
The extension of the submission date and time is also supported. 
The submitted assignments may be downloaded as a zip file or as a spreadsheet of submissions which contains the name of the student, time of submission, size of the submission, and the type of the submitted file.
The spreadsheet is by far the most effective- when a 600-word assignment is given out, the expected file size may be derived as a comparison of the file size of all the students. So a 60kb or a 1kb file when other files are 10kb should create a suspicion.
Since a spreadsheet as already been created a column may just be added for filling the scores instead of typing in all the names again thus saving the teacher tons of work.
Happy Assignment Days,

Yours Sincerely,
The Coursecode team.
